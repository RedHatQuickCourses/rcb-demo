#  The Core Duo - Task and TaskRun

* A *Task* defines a reusable, ordered set of steps (like shell commands or container images) to be executed. It's a template for work.
* A *TaskRun* is an instance of a *Task*. It represents the actual execution of a Task, providing specific inputs and parameters for that particular run.
